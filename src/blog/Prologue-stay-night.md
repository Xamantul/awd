[18:47]
It was a thrust like lightning.
A spearhead thrust to pierce my heart.
Trying to dodge it would be useless.
Being lightning, it's invisible to the human eye.
But...
The lightning that tries to pierce me...
...Is repelled by the moonlight that tries to save me.
[18:47]
Clang, a beautiful sound.
No, the sound before me is heavier than steel.
The armor she is wearing is not beautiful at all and as unrefined as the cold night.
The sound wasn't beautiful at all.
It was actually the sound of steel.
It's just that the knight is beautiful enough to turn it into a charming sound like a bell.
[18:47]
"―――I ask of you. Are you my Master?"
She asks in a voice that lights up the darkness.

"I have come forth in response to your summons.
From this time forward, my sword shall be with you and your fate shall be with me. Now, our contract is complete."
[18:48]
Yes, the contract has been completed.
When she chose me as her Master...
I'm sure I swore to help her too.

The moonlight still lights up the darkness.
As if following the knight's example, the shed again falls silent.

Time has stopped.
The scene lasts less than a second.
But...
I'm sure I'll remember this scene vividly even when I've gone to hell.

The face slightly turned.
The quiet green eyes.
The instant becomes an eternity.
The blue outfit symbolizing her sways in the wind.

――――A faint blue light filters in.
The golden hair shines in the moonlight.
[18:48]
This is a story from ten years ago.

...I'm watching someone I know very well.
A tall man with a deep-featured face, who to my knowledge has never told a joke, is patting my head.
No, that's not quite right.
I guess he doesn't know how much strength to use. So to be more accurate, he's grabbing my head and mashing it around.

I guess that's only to be expected.
After all, that's the first time he's ever patted my head.

"I'll have to get going now. You know what to do now, right?"
I answer the deep voice with a polite "yes".
The man patting my head nods once, lets go, and stands up.
...So, that was it.
If I'd known then that it was our final moment together, I would have made him laugh with my best jokes.
I had practiced telling jokes a lot, in hope that I could bring a smile to his grave face.
I guess you could say I was sad that I couldn't tell him any of them.
"Put the Association in your debt by the time you mature. I'll let you decide what to do after that. You should be able to take care of yourself."
Even though he said such things, I guess he was still worried.
He told me about the heirloom jewels, the jewels inherited from the master, and how to manage the basement.
As he was telling me all the things I didn't yet know, I realized even as a child.
―――That most likely...
He wouldn't be coming back.
...A war had started.
Not a war between countries, but a war between people.
But the only ones at war were seven people.
In a situation like this, the word "war" should be unsuitable, but here it's a different story as the ones in conflict are magi.
The seven magi, each from a different faction, had started to compete for unknown reasons and killed each other in unknown ways.

The man standing before me was one of them.
He too was in a position to kill or be killed.
He must have known more keenly than I did that his time was near.
[18:48]
"Rin, the Holy Grail will appear eventually. It is our duty as the Tohsaka family to win it. More importantly, if you want to be a magus, you can't avoid it."

Once more,
he patted my head, and left.
That was the end.
That was the last time I saw the man, who entered the Holy Grail war as a master and died. The man who was my teacher as well as my father.

"Take care, Father."

I see him off politely.
I knew I was on the verge of crying, but I shed no tears.

I loved him.
He was a great father and a great magus.
Among magi, there are only obstinate people.
In the whole world, I don't think anyone had a better character than his.
He taught me as a teacher and loved me as a father.

That's why I decided...
To choose my path according to what he left me in the end.

'――――Rin, the Holy Grail will appear eventually.
It is our duty as the Tohsaka family to win it. More importantly, if you want to be a magus, you can't avoid it――――'
In the end, he left me those words as a magus and not as a father.
That is why at that moment, my path was determined.
"――――All right. I'll do my best to be a proper magus―――"
It's only natural for a student to follow the words of their teacher.
Since then, through many twists and turns... I, Tohsaka Rin, have matured.
It has been ten years since the winter day on which my father went to war.
I haven't exactly been waiting for this moment, but I am excited.
That's only natural.
The event I have never forgotten about is about to start――――
"...Hm."
Something is ringing.
Brrring. Brrring.
"...Shut up. Stop it."
The sound doesn't stop.
It rings loudly as if I'm an enemy.
[18:50]
"...What? Come on, I was up late last night, so..."
It should let me sleep in a bit longer.
No, it has to let me sleep in.
I was deciphering my father's will until early this morning, and I've used up too much magical energy.
In other words, my mind and body are dead tired.

"Ah, geez――――you're really stubborn."
Brring. Brring. Brring. Brring.
The alarm clock doesn't speak my language.
So why does the ringing sound like it's telling me "You're going to be late"?

"...Late... Being late is bad..."
Though that depends on the situation.
I'm a good student, but maybe I can get to school at the last moment just for today.

"...That's right... I set the alarm thirty minutes early, so I should be able to sleep for thirty minutes more..."
――――Huh?
Isn't that strange?

"...Set it thirty minutes early...?"
I look at the alarm clock drowsily.
The clock is pointing exactly at seven.
I usually get up at six thirty, so the spare thirty minutes have already been used up.
...Oh, why can't I think when I wake up.
[18:50]
"...Hm."
I stare at the alarm clock for several seconds.
Shutting it off, I decide to get out of bed.

Passing through the cold hallway, I enter the cold living room.
It's seven o'clock on the last day of January.
Fuyuki City is usually pretty warm in the winter, but this morning it's as cold as any other city.
I can even see my breath indoors, and on top of that, there's no one else in the house to warm it up.

"Heater, heater..."
Turning on the heater, I head to the bathroom.
At times like this, living on your own is inconvenient.
If there were someone to wake up before me, the living room would be warm by now.

I wash my face at the sink.
I brush my long hair and get ready.
A cold morning, a cold sink.
The only advantage is that the cold water clears your sleepiness completely.

I tie my ribbon and I'm all ready.
All I have to do is eat breakfast and head out.
Looking at the clock, it's only a bit past seven, and I'm a bit disappointed.

"Man, I guess I don't have to run after all."
Then again, I would never do anything as clumsy as running to school anyway.
It is the custom of the Tohsaka family to act with composure and elegance at all times.

Taking a custom like that seriously must mean that my family originated from a very high-class background indeed.
Owning this old western-styled mansion is proof of that and on top of it, the Tohsaka family is a bloodline of sorcerers able to use the power of "Magic".
If you're talking about age, our family has an ancient history.
[18:51]
"...Well, it's not something I can brag about."
Actually, I can't speak openly about it at all.
―――Oh, by the way. I, Tohsaka Rin, am a magus―――
Who on earth can I brag to like that?

Magic is just what it sounds like... magic.
I don't care if you get ideas like abracadabra or whatever.
You can just think of us as people who do strange things by casting spells.

―――Oh, though it's not like we fly around on brooms or make stars appear with a wave of a wand.
...Well, we could do that, but we don't bother as it's kind of meaningless.
We're basically heretics who hide ourselves from the world.
We're prohibited from standing out and even if we weren't, we would rather be at home studying magic.

On top of that, the word sorcerer is completely inaccurate.
To be precise, there are only five sorcerers in the world.
Things no one can do, things beyond the ability of modern science... The ones who can make such "miracles" are the ones we call sorcerers.

Miracles that can never be achieved, regardless of time or effort... those we call sorcery.
Those things that are mysterious, but achievable with time and effort... those we call magic.
That's why what I do is called magic rather than sorcery.
It's complicated, but that's how it is, so just accept it.
[18:51]
Well, to be honest, the modern world doesn't recognize the existence of magi.
As we believe, control, and learn things that are immeasurable, our existence is incompatible with the modern world.
Because it's kind of meaningless.
Going to a normal school and becoming a normal adult will bring you far more happiness than studying magic.

Human technology is great.
In the past few hundred years, it has been leading the way ahead of magic.
Nothing is impossible for humans.
The miracles once only possible through magic are now "tools" and not miraculous at all.

―――Still, magic has its good points.
Just as there are things possible only through science,
there are also things possible only through magic.
It was the master of the Tohsaka family who said that if science is moving toward the future, magic is moving toward the past.
Something about the past and the future ending up at the same place, everything always running toward the zero point.
Let's put off all these difficult discussions. They should wait until we're old.

Finishing breakfast, I grab my bag.
"―――Oh yeah. I should bring the pendant."
I don't really want to take the thing to school, but it'd be a waste just to leave it here.

"This thing is a hundred years old after all. It's by far the greatest jewel in the house."
No, that's an understatement. It's much stronger than that.
I found this after decoding Father's will last night. It contains the equivalent of ten years of my magical energy.
There was said to be an heirloom, and this might well be it.

We, the magi of Tohsaka, are skilled at the transformation of power. We put our magical energy into jewels whenever we have free time.
To put it simply, the jewels are bullets and we are the gun.
The only other thing I can say I received from my father is the Magic Crest of the Tohsaka family engraved on my left arm.
[18:52]
In essence, this is the proof of the successor, and it's like a tattoo that condenses all the inherited magic of the Tohsaka family.
